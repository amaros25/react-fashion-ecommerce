// First, install concurrently and (optionally) nodemon so your server restarts automatically on changes:
npm install concurrently nodemon --save-dev

// Install CORS middleware to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing issues:
npm install cors

// Install Mongoose to interact with MongoDB databases easily:
npm install mongoose

// In package.json, adding
// "proxy": "http://localhost:5000",
// makes API calls from React during development forward to the backend running on port 5000

//In backend package.json
"start": "nodemon server.js"
When you run npm start in the backend folder, it runs nodemon server.js.
Nodemon watches your files and automatically restarts the server when you make changes, very useful for development!
